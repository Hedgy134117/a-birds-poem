    <h1>A Birds Poem</h1>
    By Phillip Le
    <hr />

    <img src="img/1.jpg" alt="Image 1"><br>
    In a vast expanse of green, leafy trees, there stood, a lively bird neighborhood.<br>
    There you could hear a chorus of tweets.<br>
    The sounds were beautiful and poetic,<br>
    Making a subtle echo from far away.<br>

    <br><img src="img/2.jpg" alt="Image 2"><br>
    There, in the forest, lied a newborn hatchling<br>
    He was red, and small, and he went, “tweek tweek!”<br>
    Mama and papa were so happy, they sang a joyful song together.<br>
    Chirpy loved to bounce his head to the song as they cuddled together.<br>

    <br><img src="img/3.jpg" alt="Image 3"><br>
    The next sunny day, a beautiful bird tweaked excitedly to see Chirpy.<br>
    When Chirpy opened his sleepy eyes, he was pleasantly surprised!<br>
    He never knew birds could look like that!<br>
    The colorful bird tweaked, “may I rustle his feathers?”<br>
    Chirpy’s parents nodded and the colorful bird rustled his baby feathers with his beak.<br>

    <br><img src="img/4.jpg" alt="Image 4"><br>
    Majesty tweaked, “My name is Majesty! I will sing my poem of introduction!”<br>
    <br>
    Reflections splash on my quills<br>
    My harmonic tweets sends chills<br>
    Majestic grace,<br>
    Lovely showcase,<br>
    I’ve the depth of many frills!<br>
    <br>
    “And with that, I must fly away!”<br>

    <br><img src="img/5.jpg" alt="Image 5"><br>
    Chirpy was dumbstruck<br>
    Chirpy asked his parents, “are all the birds in the neighborhood like that?”<br>
    Mama bird laughed. She tweaked, “Majesty is a unique one, but so are all the birds in the neighborhood. You’ll have
    fun meeting them when you can fly.”<br>

    <br><img src="img/6.jpg" alt="Image 6"><br>
    Days went on as Chirpy became bigger and bigger in his small nest.<br>
    He played many games with his family.<br>
    He really loved to play the game, “spot the worm”.<br>
    He would always squint his eyes at the ground really hard.<br>
    But what he wanted the most was to fly and see all the neighbor birds!<br>

    <br><img src="img/7.jpg" alt="Image 7"><br>
    One cloudy morning, Chirpy woke up and stretched his wings big and wide.<br>
    Whoosh!<br>
    All of a sudden, a strong gust of wind rushed on Chirpy’s wings.<br>
    His legs wobbled and wings tremored; He’s falling from the nest!<br>
    Chirpy closed his eyes in terror. He tried to think of what to do but the falling froze his mind!<br>
    At the last second, he did what felt natural, and spread his wings wide open.<br>

    <br><img src="img/8.jpg" alt="Image 8"><br>
    When chirpy opened his eyes, he saw that he was flying!<br>
    The more he flapped, the higher he went!<br>
    He saw the tops of the forest trees,<br>
    And the fluffy clouds above him!<br>
    However, now he could do what he wanted to do most!<br>

    <br><img src="img/9.jpg" alt="Image 9"><br>
    Chirpy dove into the neighborhood and searched for other birds like Majesty.<br>
    And there, he saw, a huge bird with a nest on the ground.<br>
    The huge bird noticed him, and tweaked excitedly.<br>
    Chirpy landed on the ground in a jumble and looked up at the big bird.<br>
    The huge bird tweaked, “You must be the new bird, chirpy!” His voice boomed and shook the ground<br>
    Chirpy asked, “how did you get so big…!”<br>

    <br><img src="img/10.jpg" alt="Image 10"><br>
    “Let me tell you my introduction poem!”<br>
    <br>
    I am Zord, a hefty one<br>
    Enormous, but mighty fun<br>
    I play checkers,<br>
    Hop-scotch peckers,<br>
    But in truth, I’ve never won<br>

    <br><img src="img/11.jpg" alt="Image 11"><br>
    Chirpy looked in awe.<br>
    Zord tweaked, “we should play checkers sometime Chirpy! <br>
    But for now, you should go home. Your parents are probably worried!”<br>
    And so, Chirpy went home, and tweaked excitedly to his worried parents.<br>

    <br><img src="img/12.jpg" alt="Image 12"><br>
    The next day, Chirpy woke up really early.<br>
    He needed to see the other birds!<br>
    Chirpy lifted his wings and steadily glided through the morning air.<br>
    With a squint of his eyes, he spotted a pitch black crow with a cloak lurking in the shadows.<br>
    Chirpy landed steadily in front of the crow.<br>
    The crow looked both ways and tweaked, “hey, got any twigs?”<br>
    Chirpy tilted his head in confusion. “Who are you?” asked Chirpy.<br>

    <br><img src="img/13.jpg" alt="Image 13"><br>
    The pitch black crow made a long sigh and started singing,<br>
    “Sketchy is my business name<br>
    I trade peas as a con game<br>
    Unreliable,<br>
    Never liable,<br>
    And not with an ounce of shame.”<br>

    <br><img src="img/14.jpg" alt="Image 14"><br>
    Chirpy tilted his head in confusion.<br>
    “Well, got any?” The crow asked.<br>
    Chirpy shook his head and the raven flew away, making a c-caw noise. <br>
    Chirpy then heard a faint echo of a song and decided it might be a new bird.<br>

    <br><img src="img/15.jpg" alt="Image 15"><br>
    He flew and flew towards the music as it became louder and louder.<br>
    Then, he finally saw a beautiful white dove.<br>
    The dove’s eyes were closed as he sang enchanting melodies that soothed the heart of Chirpy.<br>
    When the dove was finished, he opened his eyes and smiled.<br>
    He saw Chirpy with a wide grin. Chirpy quickly asked, “what’s your poem?”<br>

    <br><img src="img/16.jpg" alt="Image 16"><br>
    A white tails subtle reflection<br>
    Inspires moon night’s perfection<br>
    Elegant ease<br>
    Blows a fresh breeze,<br>
    Pushing my wings with direction<br>

    <br><img src="img/17.jpg" alt="Image 17"><br>
    Chirpy sat there in awe.<br>
    The dove tweaked, “What’s your poem, little one?”<br>
    Chirpy never thought of it before. What was his poem?<br>
    He thought of every poem he liked so far, and he decided to try and make one.<br>

    <br><img src="img/18.jpg" alt="Image 18"><br>
    Chirpy tweaked, “ Reflections splash on my red,<br>
    I’m little, but I am fed<br>
    Elegant flaps,<br>
    With tiny gasp.<br>
    I’ve no shame that, uhh, cornbread!<br>

    <br><img src="img/19.jpg" alt="Image 19"><br>
    The dove laughed for a minute and tried to regain his composure.<br>
    Chirpy was uncomfortable, he thought the dove was laughing at him!<br>
    The dove tweaked, “You’re a funny one Chirpy. Why don’t you go to your nest and make a poem! Think about yourself
    this time, not the other birds in the neighborhood!”<br>
    Chirpy smiled and nodded his head. He lifted himself and flapped back to the nest.<br>

    <br><img src="img/20.jpg" alt="Image 20"><br>
    Chirpy thought long and hard about himself. <br>
    Who was he?<br>
    What did he enjoy?<br>
    After long thought, Chirpy created his poem!<br>
    It was the dusk of morning so he decided to sing it to his parents first.<br>

    <br><img src="img/21.jpg" alt="Image 21"><br>
    “Red is the color of my feather,<br>
    And I love to hang out together<br>
    Chirpy is my name<br>
    And I love to game<br>
    I’ll always be seen in fair weather!<br>

    <br><img src="img/22.jpg" alt="Image 22"><br>
    Mama and papa bird excitedly pet Chirpy.<br>
    Papa decided to get all the birds in the neighborhood together to hear Chirpy’s poem! And so, all the birds Chirpy
    met circled around him.<br>
    Chirpy was nervous! With a big breath, Chirpy began to sing his poem.<br>
    When Chirpy was finished, they all tweaked at him and they did something unexpected… They all were singing his
    poem!<br>
    Majesty, Zord, Sketchy—even the white dove was singing it!<br>

    <br><img src="img/23.jpg" alt="Image 23"><br>
    The day went on, and the birds still sang his poem throughout the day. Chirpy was happy, all the birds loved him for
    who he was. At the end of the day, Chirpy fell asleep with love in his heart and the warmth of his parents beside
    him.<br>
    The End.<br>
